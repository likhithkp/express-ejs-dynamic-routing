This repository is dedicated to demonstrating dynamic routing with Express.js and EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templating. It provides a comprehensive guide on how to create dynamic, data-driven web applications using Express.js and EJS for rendering HTML templates.

## Overview

Express.js is a powerful web application framework for Node.js, known for its fast and minimalist approach. EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
